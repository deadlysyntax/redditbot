                                              Im surpised to see 2 Saffer's mention Thorn playing the role of shit-stirrer. My recollection doesnt involve that sort of carry on from Thorn.

                                              But given there are now two Saffers saying he was at it, perhaps im wrong?

                                                              He's also a very, very good player. This may cloud my view of him a touch.

                                                      To be fair, Eben has been very young, and fell for a few wind ups in the beginning. Now he just laughs it off, and has had great discipline for a while now. But you know, some people just have those faces.
