      Don't know how we won that. I'd be gutted if i was a Bath player.

      I was watching on a pretty bad stream there at the end and couldn't really see but it looked like the penalty should have gone to Bath.

      and the handling errors and I don't think Leinster would have been able to match
      them.

    :body: As a neutral who only saw the 2nd half thanks to BT Sport being shit. That
      was not a particularly great match. Both sides made key errors that stopped
      play really flow in the second half. As previously stated the ref also seemed
      to favour Leinster most of the time. Either way looks like Leinster will be
      playing Toulon, lets be honest Toulon are gunna beat Wasps.
