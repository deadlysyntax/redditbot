                              Boudjellal started pumping money in either - that came
                              with success.\n\nSaracens and the big PRL chairmen are
                              going after rapid expansion on the back of TV money
                              which, don't get me wrong, is there to be expanded,
                              but I think they're doing it on different principles
                              than the French.\n\nIn France, the money has increased
                              rapidly, but there's a huge part of the country that
                              is mad into rugby, even if they don't support or live
                              near the big teams. The increase in money there is partly
                              due to rugby getting its act together and redressing
                              the balance where football had been most of the money.
                              \n\nIn England/UK/Ireland, there's a much smaller base
                              to work with, so the expansion is based more on the
                              Premiership model, plus the fact rugby fans on these
                              islands tend to be quite well-off financially.  \n\nThere
                              definitely is room for rugby to make more money than
                              it has to date, but it's probably more along the golf
                              lines where it's backed by a traditionally wealthy base
                              of people. Rugby going after the soccer model of rapid
                              expansion based on big brands is... misguided."

              His business model is about pumping a lot of money into Saracens to make them the biggest club in England, then once they're the biggest club they'll be able to sustain themselves at that level without more investment. It's the Chelsea/Manchester City model, basically.

              The trouble with these types of owners is that when everything doesn't go their way, they often throw their toys out of the pram and leave the club worse off than it was before they took over, and going by the way Saracens are structured they could easily leave the club on the brink of folding.
