                      Keep watching after the line-out is taken, he gets a bit of revenge by smashing the opposing 13 into the woodwork, who then throws the ball in his face to which he responds by nearly starting another fight. He did have a bit of a temper-control issue back in those days.

                      The whole grimness of the game started when Lawes made [a brutal hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbDvGF5O6mg) on Morgan Parra, who stayed down frighteningly long and ended up going off with a serious shoulder-injury. If I remember correctly, it all went downhill from there.

      &gt;Lawes's tackle on Plisson caused uproar in France

      Loose definition of uproar. People were unhappy, like at anything going the wrong way. It made less of an uproar than an anti-Irish comment on this sub.

      Lawes has no apologies to make.

                              The best hit is man and ball which leads to a turnover.

                              A lot of Laws big hits are after the ball is played. Whilst not illegal and are excellent to watch, they don't stop the opposition.  For clarity, I am not discussing the events in OPs submission.

                              I have played rugby.

                      can put on someone is just as they're passing so as to disrupt
                      the pass and make the ball fly off. In my opinion anyway., maybe
                      you should  just stick to tag..

As you said there are plenty of enforcers in the same mould as he and it&amp;#39;s a part of the game. I personally think if a big hit can alter the way you play that&amp;#39;s a weakness you need to rectify very quickly because it&amp;#39;s an obvious one. &lt;/p&gt;

He&amp;#39;s getting a lot of media attention for this one big it that definitely did affect the french stand off in the 6 nations and that certainly did affect a part of the game.  &lt;/p&gt;

                                                                      &lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#39;s like any other destructive player, there are loads of them around the world who will sometimes catch someone just right, and then they&amp;#39;re labelled a big hitter. It&amp;#39;s not fair to say he only lines up the halves pairings but he&amp;#39;s just getting loads of aggro from people saying this one small part of his game is &amp;quot;thuggish&amp;quot; or unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

                                                                      &lt;p&gt;In fact there are a lot of locks who are generally abrasive players who get in other&amp;#39;s faces and impose themselves on the game. Eben Etzebeth, Courtney Lawes, Paul O&amp;#39;Connell, Martin Johnson etc these are/were big guys who smash little players and push their team forwards. This is all part of disrupting the opposition and getting the opposition going backwards in attack. Aggressive defense. Some people seem to have a problem with it, whilst I think this kind of discussion is pointless because it&amp;#39;s a part of the game and always has been. Sorry for the essay&lt;/p&gt;

                                      in rugby. Hitting the playmaker is obviously
                                      not going to affect the opposition. Putting
                                      in big hits is obviously pointless. Everyone
                                      should do the bare minimum always until they
                                      magically win. /s
