                      make any sense. Anscombe was essentially brought in to be a

                      than Sam Davies, Rhys Patchell or even Steve Shingler.

              Sounds like Hoeata's being his same old self. He always seemed to be on the end of a yellow card down here too.

              Where's Anscombe being played? I never really understood the hype when he played 10, but he alwayds played well at fullback for the Chiefs.

      Gareth Anscombe is yet to prove the hype he had around him.

      Hoeata had been solid, especially in the line out, but has had some problems with discipline. Most noteably a clothesline tackle on Rob Kearney.


      The two Argie guys have been good additions, sometimes they look to try to play a bit too much in the wrong areas but they have the best feet in the squad.

      Connacht:

      Tom McCartney has been exceptional. Probably the signing of the year. Slowed down a little bit after a strong start.
      Bundee Aki started very well, and started to show fledgings of a promising centre partnership with Henshaw before getting injured.
      Most of Muliaina's impact has been off the pitch, but I fully believe he's been a big reason for the surrounding players growth and development.

      Other expats include Heenan who is so good when fit, but is rarely fit; Ah You can be lethal or lazy, Poolman is getting better and better, and Quinn Roux is finally realising his potential.
      Nathan White has been excellent until he qualified to be Irish and then can't get fit.

      Leinster:

      Kane Douglas hasn't been bad. Kirchner's been better than what I expected but not enough for the money spent
      Te'o is improving.
      Gopperth is being handicapped by some strange gameplans.
      Cheetahs prop Maks van Dyk was here and looked very ordinary.

      Ulster
      Jared Payne is an exceptional fullback,
      Ludik has been better than I expected, Pienaar also. Pienaar seems better for Ulster than for SA by a mile.
      Wiehahn Herbst is a beast in the scrum.
      Franco van der Mere has been uninspring.
      Nick Williams started great two years ago but needs to move on.

      Munster
      Andrew Smith has been so so
      Pat Howard was great and improving when he was here for 3 months
      CJ Stander is developing a cult following
      Gerhard van den heever hasn't been seen since his strong start to his Munster career.
      Still yet to see Tyler Bleyendaal play.

      For Sale:

      Sam Tuitupou has been pretty excellent this year, as both a bosh centre and a big hitter. Johnny Leota has done more of the former less of the latter. Dan Braid is the most neccesary player in our team (more so than Cipriani) for his leadership alone.

      And Michael Paterson left the first chance he could for a bigger club and large pay packet, then got injured. Great stuff Mike

    :body: Salesi Ma'afu is leaving Saints for Toulon at the end of the season. He's
      always been a good prop for us, if a little impetuous. I'm not particularly
      gutted about losing him (mostly because it's overshadowed by us losing Manoa
      which is heartbreaking), we've got good enough replacements, but he was always
      a very reliable prop.
