    :body: Clermont use them at training. I think there are ways you can program them
      to follow players or the ball etc. They apparently even get live footage on
      their tablets and are able to show the players what they're doing wrong during
      training. That's pretty awesome for the backs moves in particular.

            :body: Actually, something I was thinking of that I'd really like someone
              to come up with is a GPS-type device in the ball which the drone can
              track and stay behind or above with minimal input from the user. That
              would be fantastic from a coaching standpoint.

                              They might be easier to maintain than hundreds of feet of wiring and I think they offer more possible angles by being more agile.

                              The whole setup around the camera rig also seems to be a lot more compact. The spidercam rig is massive.

                              And, obviously, a drone can be used anywhere as long as the weather isn't too crazy. A spidercam needs to have a pretty elaborate setup in the stadium.

                    :body: I can remember Mike Phillips belting the ball into the
                      one in Paris once. I'm not sure if there are provisions in the
                      laws for what to do if the ball hits spidercam.
