              Yeah, that's the deja vu part.

              Red card against the Crusaders for stamping/kneeing a player on the ground.

              Making it hard for themselves, I just wish the Blues got to play them next week, it could be just the kind of boost we need.

      Was it Chiefs or Crusaders he got a red in last year for stamping? Sharks sporting 3 bans of 1st team players now...
