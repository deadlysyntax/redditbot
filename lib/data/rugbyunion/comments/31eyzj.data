                              Yeah, I would watch a few more before deciding if I liked it.

                              If you only want to watch in the afternoon UK/Ireland time then you will inevitably be watching South African teams. The Bulls who are playing next are emerging as probably the best of them this year. Pollard is turning them into a force.

                                      can offload and play rugby.

      was gonna watch in the morning from the start, but spoiled myself after a late night out - wow. Think the Crusaders have won so I'll close at half time. and watch the first 20 minutes and 2nd half tomorrow.

      Who scored the first two?

              Oh crap.  Fox studios sports bar will have it.  The Town Hall in Balmain not a bad bet either.  Australia in general is a shitty place to try and watch sport and a sports bar is where you find 300 pokey machines.

              Watching rugby on TV and English football on my laptop.  All games going well.

                              oohp, now my internet is playing up.

                              You need a dodgy program, if you get "acestream media player" or whatever it's called, it's an extension to vlc player, you install that, then you copy paste it into "acestream content id" under the "media" dropdown menu on the top left

                              Think it switched to wrestling or something while my internet was playing up, so im gonna head to bed. See if it works though, even if it wrestling, because the quality is so much better than normal streams, and you'll know how to do it in future if someone gives you the link
