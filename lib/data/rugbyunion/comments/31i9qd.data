            :body: School rugby hasn't the same weight in Munster. You can definitely
              get picked up through club rugby. Play with a decent club and, if you're
              good enough, you'll get noticed.

    :body: 'Easiest way in Ireland to get noticed is go to a rugby playing school.
      Otherwise you''re gonna have to be so amazingly better than everyone around
      you at club level (a la Sean O''Brien). If you look at the Leinster team from
      yesterday I''d say that Sean was the only Irish player who came through the
      club system... Basically find your nearest rugby school and see if you can afford
      your one or two  remaining school years there. '

              like my best bet to be honest. I don't think my parents would allow

      Agreed with all the other comments (school and rugby university)

      Failing that, moving to a bigger club like Lansdowne, Galwegians, Buccaneers, Cork Con, or UL Bohs could help
