    :body: 'Easiest way in Ireland to get noticed is go to a rugby playing school.
      Otherwise you''re gonna have to be so amazingly better than everyone around
      you at club level (a la Sean O''Brien). If you look at the Leinster team from
      yesterday I''d say that Sean was the only Irish player who came through the
      club system... Basically find your nearest rugby school and see if you can afford
      your one or two  remaining school years there. '

            :body: Yeah I will be going to university and I think that does sound
              like my best bet to be honest. I don't think my parents would allow
              me to move school as I have moved schools a few times already and I'm
              doing very well academically in my current one. I just hope that the
              club I'm in can give me the coaching I need..

    :body: 'Are you looking to go to university? Places like UCD have a load of U20
      internationals and Leinster Academy players on the team. Might be worth it to
      put together a video of your highlights and get in contact with guys like Bobby
      Byrne or John Hammond there. They''re pretty approachable. Depending on how
      your Leaving Cert is going, obviously. You can check out the other universities
      (NUIG, UCC, UL, QUB, and UUJ), depending on your province, but unless you''ve
      grown up playing with one of the big clubs, going to a university team is probably
      your best bet. They are pretty well connected with the provincial teams, particularly

      Agreed with all the other comments (school and rugby university)

      Failing that, moving to a bigger club like Lansdowne, Galwegians, Buccaneers, Cork Con, or UL Bohs could help
