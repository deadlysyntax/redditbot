    :body: When I first saw this thread I was going to comment about how it'll be
      nice to watch our plate quarter final match ... god thing I didn't make that
      joke. The Canada that was just on the field was the team from last season and
      we definitely could have been playing like that all year. We beat England s
      few months ago so maybe it's not unrealistic to make it into the final?

                      Absolutely, one of the teams of the year, their progress under Friday has been brilliant.

                      I know Isles gets a lot of ribbing on here, but his game has come on leaps and bounds this year.

      This is the most insane Day 2 schedule I've ever seen.

      Australia, USA and Argentina all going to the Bowl while Japan, France, Scotland and Canada all slip into the Cup.

      Going to be a fun day regardless.

                      Ya bender looked good. In HK he looked a little slow but not in japan. We are in a great position in terms of forwards. Just need someone that can backup a Hughes/Niua role

                      I get the sense that Niua is a bit inconsistent? Maybe? So you risk losing more simple kicks. Or Hughes is much better in training? We really don't have anyone that's particularly good. That'll be a bigger issue if we keep contesting top teams. US probably hits under 30% of conversions that aren't near the posts

              Bender was great too. We're a really deep squad now.

              Just curious, why doesn't Niua kick? Feel he'd be MUCH better than Hughes.

      Watching the US dismantle Portugal 39-0 makes me happy but even more pissed at Niua for his stupid suspension. The difference with him in the middle is so clear.

      Also Leuta is a beast. I hope he can tackle. I think he may be pushing pat Blair out permanently. Leuta, Barrett, Duratolo, and bender is a nasty group of forwards.

      Subs going forward are probably Leuta and Bender, baker and Iosefo, and don't know the 5th. Iosefo isn't a speedster. You need someone with some pace who can play at fly or scrum. I don't think Augspurger is it. I guess there is some flexibility to move test out into the backs

              A little redemption.

              I'm hoping Test was sat for his quality of play. He ignores so many offload/overload opportunities to just go for the line break.
