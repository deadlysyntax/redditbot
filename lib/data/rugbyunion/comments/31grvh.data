                              two he missed off the tee ended up being the difference.

            :body: He's a great playmaker but his kicking is still very poor. Similar
              to Madigan - he's great if you're on the front foot and putting the
              ball through hands, but I'm not convinced he can control a game. He's
              five years younger than Madigan though so he has time.
